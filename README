# ring-jetty-servlet-adapter

The main difference between this jetty adapter and the one included in
ring is the addition of additional servlet specific information to the
request map. It relies on ring.util.servlet to dynamically generate a
servlet, whose implementation adds servlet specific keys to the
request map. This servlet then gets used to create the jetty handler.

Specifically, the following new keys are available:

* :servlet
* :servlet-request
* :servlet-response
* :servlet-context

Additionally, the run-jetty function supports an option to generate a
custom jetty handler. This can be useful if any custom configuration
is required.

:make-jetty-handler

This should be a function that accepts a single argument, the ring
handler, and returns a jetty Handler.

## Usage

(run-jetty ring-handler {:port 3000 :join? false})
