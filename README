# ring-jetty-servlet-adapter

The main difference between this jetty adapter and the one included in ring is that this one adds a reference to a servlet to the request map. It does this by using a different jetty handler, namely the servlet context one. This can be useful because since a servlet is exposed, the development environment can more closely simulate a production environment in some scenarios. And this may possibly reduce or even eliminate the need to have separate middleware chains for development and production.

## Usage

(run-jetty ring-handler {:port 3000 :join? false})
